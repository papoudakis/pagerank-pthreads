# PageRank with PThreads

This is a parallel implementation on PageRank algorithm using C++ and PThreads.

## Execution 
In order to compile the source code just run:
```
make
```
For running the serial version run:
```
./pagerank_serial.exe graphFileName
```
and for parallel version:
```
./pagerank_pthreads.exe graphFileName
```
where graphFileName is the name of the graph that PageRank will use. Many free 
graphs can be downloaded from [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/)
